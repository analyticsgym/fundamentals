# Data Insights Presentation Best Practices

#### 1. Use a story structure to package insights

-   A story structure makes the content easier to digest and retain.
-   Folks can spread the story internally to inspire action/change.

#### 2. Questions to answer before building out your presentation outline

-   Who is your audience?
-   What is your audience looking to achieve?
-   What do you want the audience to takeaway/do?
-   Check back with stakeholders if there's a vague understanding of the
    above.

#### 3. Build your story outline OUTSIDE of slides

-   Use idea-collection tools that enable flexibility and movement of
    ideas without walling in your thinking (i.e. sticky notes, docs,
    text editor, whiteboards).
-   Edits in slides are slow and feels like destroying work / wasted
    work.
-   Analysts who attempt to start complex presentations from scratch in
    slides tend to have slow presentation creation workflows, get bogged
    down, and end up without a story that connects across slides.
-   Once the story outline is in place, moving content into slides
    should be quick.

#### 4. Start with a bullet point exec summary

-   Use the following as a starting point framing for the exec summary
    (1 to 3 bullets for each element):
    -   Situation: framing of relevant context/background
    -   Challenge / opportunity: reason the situation requires action
    -   Resolutions / recommendations: actions required to address the
        challenge / opportunity
-   More details on the exec summary story outline:
    -   We're not reinventing the wheel here. The story summary has a
        beginning, middle, and end (similar to a movie).
    -   Situation context sets the movie scene and describes who the
        characters are. Then there's a challenge or opportunity the main
        character is up against, which results in a resolution.
    -   Even if you don't include an exec summary in your presentation,
        it'll help synthesize your thinking.
    -   Additionally, writing out a bullet point exec summary will
        assist in verbal communication of critical takeaways to leaders.
    -   The exec summary should take about 60 to 90 seconds to
        communicate.
    -   At the top of the exec summary, we should have a strong headline
        that captures the audience and communicates why they should care
        (this is often called the "so what" headline or the TL;DR (too
        long didn't read) headline.

#### 5. Outline slide headlines and sub-bullets that support the exec summary story

-   Map out headlines for the key insights. Each slide headline could
    include supporting sub-bullets.
-   Slide headlines should be descriptive enough to communicate the
    story without reading slide sub-bullets.
-   As a starting point, consider having three to five heavy-hitting
    insight headlines.
-   After this work is complete, then consider transitioning to building
    slides.

#### 6. Watch out for data insights presentation pitfalls

-   No clear audience benefit or "so what"
-   The presentation is a data dump without relevant and actionable
    findings
-   The presentation flow is hard to follow
-   The content is too detailed / too long
-   The story punchline is at the end of the presentation vs at the
    start
