# Notes on PostgreSQL

-   Access, aggregate, and create analytics datasets.

#### Why PostgreSQL (aka Postgres) vs other SQL dialects? 

-   Postgres is open-source (free to use).
-   Postgres has advanced functionality, robust documentation, and adheres closely to SQL standards.
-   Experience and practice with PostgreSQL is highly transferable to other SQL dialects (both open-source and proprietary). For example, Amazon Redshift SQL is similar to open-source PostgresSQL.
