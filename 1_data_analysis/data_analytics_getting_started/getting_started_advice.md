### Which skill area is most important? 
Folks often first build the hard skill areas (sql, stats, visualization, analysis, etc). The soft skill areas (business acumen, communication, etc) tend to come from on-the-job applied practice vs. a university setting. The soft skills power our curiosity to ask questions that yield new insights and assist us in relaying findings back to stakeholders in a way that resonates.

Top analysts build a strong understanding across the hard and soft skill foundation areas.

### What data tools to learn first?[^1]
Early on, it's overwhelming to figure out what tools to learn and in what order.

I’d recommend prioritizing the tools that help you get to delivering business value the fastest.

The below learning order is often a good starting point for most folks.

[^1]: future todo: why consider learning open source/free tools first vs paid tools.

##### 1. Spreadsheet software (Excel or Google Sheets)
Spreadsheet software is the most common data tool across business departments. 

Anyone planning to grow their career in data should at least understand the following spreadsheet basics: deriving statistics/metrics, pivot tables, vlookups, and common visualizations.

##### 2. SQL
Next, learn to write SQL code to transform, organize, and extract data from database systems.

Early on, when spreadsheets are your only data tool, folks will rely on data extracts from a UI or data dumps provided by a business partner. This works out ok to start, but as you advance, you’ll want to iterate quickly on the data format, time window, etc. Being able to access database tables directly without a middle person or tool is going to be very handy.

##### 3. Dashboard / Visualization Tool
After a solid grasp of spreadsheets and SQL, move to learn a relevant dashboard/visualization tool.

Dashboard/visualization tools help you create self-service data tools that can inform stakeholder actions. Warning: avoid creating dashboard data dumps. For tips and inspiration, see Avinash Kausik’s dashboard best practices.

Looker or Tableau could be good options to explore.

##### 4. Python or R
Lastly, make a move to learn Python or R. Writing code to do analysis will help you scale your work and speed up repetitive tasks. Additionally, updating analyses, reviewing analysis logic, reuse work from previous analyses are all easier when you have code vs. a spreadsheet.

In short, Python tends to be more intuitive to learn for most folks and stronger in some machine learning areas. R tends to be stronger at custom data visualizations and includes a wider range of supporting data analysis/statistical packages. 

When starting out, pick Python or R to learn deeply vs skimming the surface of both. 

After you have an advanced understanding of one language, consider learning the other language at least to an intermediate level so you can read and understand code from colleagues in that language.

### Learn + Practice + Apply

The field of data analytics is rapidly evolving. 

Continuous learning is necessary whether you are a junior analyst level or VP.

Learn + Practice + Apply = a simple formula for adding new skills to your analytics toolbox.

<ins>Learn: invest the time to acquire the knowledge.</ins>

There are multiple paths one might take to learn new analytics skills: reading textbooks, reading blogs, university courses, online learning platforms, etc. 

Some folks prefer the formal education route vs. others prefer self-guided online learning.

The key is to find the path that works for you, given your desired outcome. 

Pro tip: experiment with adding learning time to your daily or weekly routine. The more habitual learning time becomes, the less mental energy is required to transition into learning mode.

<ins>Practice: put your learning into action.</ins>

Practice techniques and methods on projects outside of critical work deliverables. 

Practice recall by drafting a memo (for your future self) that explains the new skill in detail.

Pro tip: add the practice code/memo to GitHub or Google Drive so you can quickly revisit it for a refresher when needed at work.

<ins>Apply: use the new skill on the job.</ins>

Naturally, the knowledge further sinks in when you have practiced and applied the new skill to real-world problems[^2].

### Always Be Learning[^3]
Continuous learning seems to be the most common behavior trait among top performers across any discipline. 

Learning methods vary by top performer and discipline: some folks read, listen, watch, practice, or talk to experts to acquire knowledge.

Top performers then apply the learning/knowledge in a way that produces elite results.

“Most people won’t put in the time to get a knowledge advantage.” [Mark Cuban blog post](https://blogmaverick.com/2009/05/13/success-motivation/)

“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time — none, zero. You’d be amazed at how much Warren reads–and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I’m a book with a couple of legs sticking out.” [Charlie Munger: Poor Charlie’s Almanack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578643031/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0)

“When I need to learn about a new subject, I’ll definitely devour some books on the topic, but I almost always supplement this reading by seeking out dialogue with leading experts in the field.” [Reid Hoffman: Blitzscaling](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791239V7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
