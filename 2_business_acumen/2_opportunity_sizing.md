# Opportunity Sizing

Not all customer problems are worth solving. 

Top companies identify the critical customer problems to solve with a significant opportunity size.

The formula below can help stack rank potential customer problems to investigate further. 

Each factor gets a score between 1 and 10.

Opportunity Rank = Volume x Frequency x Pain
- Volume = Number of customers/prospects with the problem?
- Frequency = How often does the problem occur?
- Pain = If a current solution exists and works well, then the pain factor is low. Pain is high to medium if a current solution doesn't exist or is lacking.
