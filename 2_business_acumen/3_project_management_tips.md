# Project Management Best Practices

*Pro tip: always have one to three “tweetable” bullets handy on a project’s status/results. An executive might ask for an update when you’re crossing paths at the office or via Slack right before a meeting.* 

### Phase 1. Initiate
##### Understand the business case
- Frame out the project objective
- Understand why and how the project ties to company OKRs / priorities
- Justify the need for a solution and your/team's time investment
 
##### Feasibility analysis
- Ideate on various solution paths
- Are there viable solution paths given business constraints (scope, time, cost)?
- What’s the investment/resource needed?
- Is there a simple solution that can drive value fast (simplicity scales)? 
- Get feedback and collaborate with internal partners here

##### Sponsorship
- For more significant projects, it’s often wise to get buy-in from stakeholders/leaders before moving too far into execution mode

### Phase 2. Plan
##### Build your execution plan
- Break down the tasks into buckets
- Identify partner/resource needs
- Identify risks
- Communication plan to key partners/stakeholders

##### Kick-off meeting
- Review the objective and how the project links to company priorities
- Prioritize tasks
- Share the ownership (more = better)
- Open up for feedback and questions

### Phase 3. Execute + Monitor 
##### Complete the work in the plan
- Ideas are like toilet paper... execution is gold

##### Monitor progress
- Track variance from the plan
- Watch out for scope creep
- Avoid scope creep by setting clear expectations during the plan and initiate phase

##### Stakeholder management
- Communicate synthesized updates to stakeholders
- Notify stakeholders if things are off track or progress blockers hit
- Don’t just bring problems to stakeholders (also have starting point solution ideas for the problems)
- Manage expectations where needed

### Phase 4. Close
- Deliver the project output
- Let stakeholders and partners know the project has ended
- Document and communicate results + learnings
- Thank your partners
- Celebrate wins and learnings
