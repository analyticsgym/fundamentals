# Mission / Goal / Strategy / Tactics

### 1) Mission Statement[^1]
- Makes it clear why we exist and why we make the decisions we do. 
- The mission should inspire action and a following.
- Example: “We’re in business to save our home planet.” – Patagonia

### 2) Goal 
- A target aligned with the mission. 
- Example: In 2023, give $X million in profits to Y environmental partners.

### 3) Strategy
- A plan that supports the mission and helps the team achieve the goal. 
- Said differently, the strategy is a set of actions to overcome challenges/obstacles to achieving the goal.
- The strategy often involves designing how to deploy resources, partnership plays, team development, execution paths, etc. 
- Example: Patagonia has a strategy to reduce environmental harm when sourcing raw materials for products.

### 4) Tactics
- Granular actions within each of the strategy elements. 
- Executing on the tactics = the foundation for the strategy.
- Example: A [Patagonia YouTube ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAZ8Ts9CC6I) that encourages folks to buy used/repair old gear vs buying brand new gear.

*These concepts represent the compass and execution architecture of a business.*
